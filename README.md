### Header Section

The header section includes a basic "Nav Bar" with navigation links to HOME, VIDEOS, RESOURCES, ABOUT AND CONTACT US.

### Hamburger button

The hamburger button uses JavaScript and opens an overlay. The overlay opens when the hamburger button is clicked and closes when the "x" button is clicked.

```JavaScript
/* Open when someone clicks on the span element */
function openNav() {
    document.getElementById("myNav").style.width = "100%";
}

/* Close when someone clicks on the "x" symbol inside the overlay */
function closeNav() {
    document.getElementById("myNav").style.width = "0%";
}
```
